  > In "proj/urls.py":
     > Change "from app import urls as app_urls" to "from NEW_NAME import urls as NEW_NAME_urls
     > Change "from app import views as app_views" to "from NEW_NAME import views as NEW_NAME_views"

  > In "app/urls.py":
     > Change "from app import views" to "from NEW_NAME import views"

  > In "apps/app.py":
     > Change "name = 'app'" to "name = 'NEW_NAME'"
